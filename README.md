# [OC] Project 7 : Develop the back-end of a book rating site
This repository contains the HTML/CSS/JS code to address the problem of the sixth OpenClassrooms project.

## Context

I've been a freelance back-end developer in the Lille area for a year now. 
I often work with Kévin, a more experienced front-end developer. 
He contacted me to work with him on a book referencing and rating site.

## Available Scripts

You need Frontend with this project.

### Before start backend

You need to create .env file at the root of this project. In this file, use DB_USER= and DB_PWD= for your access to your mongoDB.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `nodemon server`

When you read « Connexion à MongoDB réussie ! », backend run correctly.
